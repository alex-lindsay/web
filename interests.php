      <p>I was fortunate to grow up in a household with two writers as parents. I learned at a young age that how we use words is an art, and can be powerful. However, as a kid, when asked "What do I want to be when I grow up", my answer was "a mathematician". Believe it or not.</p>
      <p>This love for math and appreciation for language drew me to grammar. I confess to having loved diagramming sentences.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've studied a number of languages, some briefly, some more consistently. I've taken courses in Linguistics, even considered pursuing a Master's in it. </p>
      <p>To this day, I routinely spend no small part of my free time reading on matters of language and follow more language podcasts than any other topic at this time.</p>

      <p>A number of years ago, when I first transitioned from being a hands-on manager to being a hands-off one, focusing on team development and project success, I found myself itching to do some coding.</p>
      <p>I would work on coding puzzles, and some personal projects, but I was feeling a different sort of challenge facing me as well.</p>
      <p>As I mention elsewhere, I come from parents who were writers. But, my father was also a painter. My aunt, a painter and sculptor as well. My grandfather, a talented calligrapher. Throughout my family there were (and are) a variety of talented artists. I felt challenged to create.</p>
      <p>I ran across <a href="https://processing.org">processing.org</a> and quickly found myself engaged in algorithmic art.</p>

      <p>I have had an interest and engagement with photography throughout my life. Starting with my first film SLR camera, which I still have, through the arrival of digital SLRs, pocket digital cameras, through to the marvel that is the collection of cameras we have available to us on our contemporary phones.</p>
      <p>I think there were two factors that came into play for me here: differentiating my creativity from others in my family, and an attraction to the intersection of art and technology.</p>
      <p>Early on, I took photos of cars and landmarks, and some people here and there, but I found myself drawn to shooting architecture.</p>
      <p>For me there is an intersection that lives here among many of my interests. I love to find geometry in my subjects, the buildings, the cities, the world in which we live. I aim to find contrast between the man-made and the natural, creating a harmony between positive space and negative space.</p>
      <p>I also love to find pattern and structure in the world around us, often located in the grooves of tiles, or the reflections light from windows on a facing building.</p>

      <p>I can't put a finger quite to how I became interested in architecture, but I was certainly influenced by the work that my grandfather did in running a construction company that built custom homes.</p>
      <p>For me the tehnical drawings and blueprints were fascinating. Precise, geometric, explicit. Those designs were a way to communicate what would be translated into sculpture. Functional scultpure — which could be lived in, worked in.</p>
      <p>The part of me that was drawn to technology and futurism found an attraction for the stules that were presented as futuristic and forward looking.</p>
      <p>Sleek, geometric, technological, the modern drew me to it. I have an appreciation for other styles and approaches to architecture, as I do to art, but the abstract rests at the apex of design.</p>

      <p>My parents ran an advertising and marketing agency when I was young. In an era before computers and word processing, copy layout would be done by hand, literally cutting and pasting text and images or sketches to build out concepts or templates.</p>
      <p>To facilitate with mocking up copy or designs, there was a product called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letraset">Letraset</a> which would allow someone to rub letters of different fonts in different sizes onto paper.</p>
      <p>I was fascinated by these, and by the type books that we had in the house, used for selecting fonts to be used for different ad concepts.</p>
      <p>Related to my appreciation for calligraphy, which I practiced with my grandfather, this was an avenue that instilled in me a love for how we write physically, that has lived alongside a love for how we write conceptually.</p>
      <p>One year, as presents for Christmas, I selected different fonts, purchased Letraset letters, and made master copies of stationery for my mother, my sister, and my brother, which I then got color copied into a stack of stationery paper for each of them.</p>
      <p>My mother, impressed with my effort asked me to design some stationery for her business as a writing/author representation agency; stationary which she continued to use for the rest of the time the company operated.</p>

      <p>Geography is an interesting beast. For many, it calls to mind maps, maps, and still more maps. For others it encompasses the physical world we live in — the rivers, the mountains, the islands, the oceans. For still others, it's about the people, the places, the communities, the cultures.</p>
      <p>I started out a map geek, going back to learning the counties of the State of New Jersey, the capitals of the states. I always wanted an atlas; collected a few road atlases, world atlases, printed, eventually digital...until the internet made that unnecessary.</p>
      <p>As I've grown older, I've found so much more interest in the political geography, the cultural geography — the ways in which we've mapped our selves onto the terrain we inhabit.</p>
      <p>To this day, I still would love to collect world atlases published in different countries, combining my love of language with my love of places.</p>
